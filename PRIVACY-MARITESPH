MARITES PH is a news aggregator app designed to keep users informed about trending topics in the Philippines. We prioritize transparency in how we handle data and where our news comes from.

1. Information We Collect
We aim for maximum privacy. We do not require a user account to read news.

Technical Data: We may collect basic device information (OS version, device model) and IP addresses to prevent spam and ensure app stability.

No Personal Data: We do not collect names, phone numbers, or precise GPS locations.

No Financial Info: We do not collect or store credit card or payment data.

2. News Sourcing & Content
In compliance with Google Play’s News Policy:

Official Sources: MARITES PH aggregates content from credited, official media websites and public RSS feeds.

Attribution: Every article displayed in the app clearly identifies the original publisher and provides a direct link to the source website.

No Original Reporting: We do not claim ownership of the news content; we act as a portal to help users find official reports easily.

3. Children’s Privacy (Users Under 13)
Our app is intended for a general audience.

We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under 13.

If you are a parent and believe we have accidentally received information from a child, contact us at tiralcodes+marites@gmail.com and we will delete it immediately.

4. Third-Party Services
We use limited third-party tools to help the app function:

Google Play Services: Required for app distribution and security.

External Links: When you click a news story, you may be directed to the official publisher’s website. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those external sites.

5. Compliance with Philippine Law
We operate in accordance with the Philippine Data Privacy Act of 2012 (RA 10173). We respect your rights to be informed and to have your data protected. Because we do not store personal profiles, your "right to be forgotten" is built into the app's design by default.

6. Contact Information
