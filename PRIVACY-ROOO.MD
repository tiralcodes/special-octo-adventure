ROOO Privacy Policy
Last Updated: February 11, 2026

Hey there! Thanks for checking out ROOO. We're all about keeping things simple and, most importantly, respecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your information when you use our app.

1. What Information Do We Collect?

We try to collect as little as possible, but to make ROOO work its best, we might collect a few things:

Information you give us directly:

Your Contact Info: If you reach out to us at tiralcodes+rooo@gmail.com, we'll use your email to respond to your questions or feedback. We won't do anything else with it unless you explicitly agree.
Any other info you voluntarily share: If you decide to share something else with us through the app (like feedback or bug reports), we'll use it to improve ROOO.
Information we collect automatically (but don't worry, it's anonymized or aggregated!):

Usage Data: We might look at how people are using ROOO – things like which features are popular, how often the app is opened, or if it crashes. This helps us figure out what's working and what needs fixing. We don't tie this data back to you personally.
2. How Do We Use Your Information?

We use the information we collect for a few key reasons:

To Make ROOO Better: This is our main goal! We use usage data to understand how people interact with the app so we can improve its performance, fix bugs, and add features you'll love.
To Communicate with You: If you email us, we'll use your email address to reply. It's as simple as that.
To Keep ROOO Safe and Secure: We want to make sure our app is a safe place for everyone. We might use information to detect and prevent fraud or misuse.
3. Will We Share Your Information?

Seriously, we don't have much to share, and we don't plan to!

We won't sell your personal information. Ever.
We might share anonymized or aggregated data: This means information that can't be used to identify you personally. We might share this kind of data with trusted partners to help us understand trends or improve our services.
If required by law: In rare cases, we might have to share information if a legal process requires it.
4. Your Choices and Control

You're in charge!

You can choose not to provide certain information: If you don't want to share something, you don't have to. Just be aware that it might limit some of ROOO's functionality.
You can contact us: If you have questions about your data or want to request that we delete any personal information we might have, just drop us a line at tiralcodes+rooo@gmail.com.
5. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We implement security safeguards designed to protect the information we maintain.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We might update this policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we'll try our best to let you know, perhaps by posting a notice in the app or sending an email. Please review this policy periodically to stay informed.
