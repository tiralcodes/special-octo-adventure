At SWELDO CALC PH, we provide a simple tool for Filipino workers to estimate their take-home pay. We believe your financial data is personal, which is why we have built this app with a "privacy-first" approach.

1. Transparency on Data Collection
   
We want to be 100% clear: SWELDO CALC PH does not collect, store, or share any personal or sensitive user data.

No Salary Data Storage: Any salary figures, deductions, or tax information you enter into the calculator stay on your device. We do not transmit this data to any servers.

No Personal Info: We do not ask for your name, address, SSS/GSIS numbers, or contact details.

Device Data: We do not track your location, contacts, or device identifiers.

2. Children’s Privacy (Users Under 13)
Because our target audience may include students or young workers under the age of 13, we strictly comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and Google Play’s Families Policy.

We do not collect any personal information from children.

The app does not contain social features, chat rooms, or any way for a child to publicly post information.

If you believe a minor has contacted us via email and shared personal details, please contact TIRALCODES at the email above, and we will delete that information immediately.

3. Third-Party Services & Permissions
To keep your experience clean and secure:

No Third-Party SDKs: We do not use third-party analytics (like Firebase or Facebook) or advertising networks that track child users.

Permissions: The app requires no special permissions (such as Camera, Microphone, or Location) to function.

4. Data Security
Since all calculations happen locally on your phone, your data is as secure as your device is. We use standard industry practices to ensure the app itself is secure and free of malicious code.

5. Compliance with Philippine Laws
We respect the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (RA 10173) of the Philippines. Since we do not "process" (collect or store) your personal data as defined by the law, we ensure your right to privacy is fully protected by design.

6. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy if we add new features. We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. We encourage you to check this page occasionally.
